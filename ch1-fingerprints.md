## Ch 1


In this chapter we learn about a bunch of attempts to make the classical view of emotion
happen. Spoiler alert, it doesn't happen. 

The author starts by trying to reproduce an experiment, something about depression vs
anxiety, something that was supposed to be easy. What she encountered was either a bunch
of people who weren't in touch with their emotions, or perhaps lizard people, who as we
know, aren't actually people, because they are lizards. Anyway, many of the participants
were unable to distinguish between various emotions - often grouping distinct
experiences of a given "category" under an umbrella. For example, confusing "sad" and
"afraid", or similarly for pleasant emotions like "calm" and "proud". 

I'm not sure what the underlying reason for this was, but my understanding of the
author's interpretation is "the participants are wrong, and we should teach them how to
not be wrong". To do this, you would ostensibly need an objective measurement of
emotions, to compare with. Based on many classical emotion studies, the face should be a
good indicator of this. So, we measure facial movements, right?

Some background: originally people did studies where actors posed for given emotions,
and they showed these pictures to people all over the world, where everyone guessed them
right. So they concluded that emotion recognition is universal, case closed. But someone
else was like "wait, maybe we should measure some sort of.. measurement". This was
called a facial EMG, and involved attaching electrodes to faces of participants and
making them feel things, to see what happens to their faces. Apparently this could at
most distinguish pleasant from unpleasant, but falls quite short of being a *fingerprint*.

Things get interesting when context is added to an emotion recognition test. Suppose you
have a picture of someone who is mad about something, and use the magic of computers to
photoshop that face onto someone holding a dirty diaper, which would originally be
representative of "disgust". And since you have this carefully crafted photo, you might
as well ask someone what emotion is being conveyed. The result: 9/10 ~~dentists~~
participants identify it as disgust (note: this statistic is made up for dramatic
effect).

In general, there are multiple ways to respond to things in life that might go by the
same name but are not quite the same. You get scared at a movie and react by closing
your eyes, but if you see a tiger on the street you probably won't close your eyes
except maybe to blink.¹

Next step: measure the body. You can do this by having people make a face that should
correspond to an emotion and measuring skin conductance (sweat) and arm tension. You
read that right, the theory was that making a face will induce that emotion, and trigger
a physical response. This actually *kinda* worked, but not quite. There was not enough
resolution to distinguish between similar enough emotions, and the feedback mechanism
was probably due to people actually identifying the emotions based on the face and thus
thinking about something that would cause them to feel something. Making a face without
any context or expectation doesn't do the same thing.

It is known that studies ended up finding essentially different fingerprints for what
should have been the same emotion. There is too much variation in the way one can
express something, apparently. This called for a meta analysis of these studies, and
it/they were so meta that it/they found little to no consistency across the individual
studies.² 

Easily the best part of the chapter is when the author presents these findings, and some
people are like "u wot mate?". And they express this anger in so many ways: yelling, calm
threats, silent indignation, literally shaking their head, etc. Their reactions to a
statement that emotions are variable having such variation should really be a Seinfeld
episode.

Next step: measure the brain. You know, just measure it. That must be where the emotions
are.³ 

Anyway.. there was a woman who didn't have an amygdala, or maybe she did but it was not
intact. People noticed she didn't get scared of things and that must have been
surprising since aren't we all afraid? Or is it just me. Don't answer that. She was
shown scary movies, and had an airhorn blown in her vicinity without warning, and none
of that made her skin conductance change. This would imply the amygdala is the localized
center of fear, and if that were true wouldn't that be nice, and we could finally remove
them and be so brave. But someone noticed that she could understand fear in others, and
identify it. Moreover, she *did* feel fear, when they replace some of her air with
non-air (carbon dioxide).

The moral of the story is emotions are *degenerate*. Not that kind. It means there are
multiple ways that the brain can create a given emotion. Another, probably more accurate
phrasing would be that emotions are actually *categories*, which make sense to group
together but arise from a range of brain patterns, in a many-to-one fashion.

Another conclusion we're just gonna throw in here is that the brain consists of "core
systems". These are responsible for various tasks, which vary depending on the context.
And I do mean various - memory, sight, analysis, even emotional experiences. This is
literally not degenerate at all, it's the opposite - one-to-many, i.e. one neuron or one
subsystem can be involved in a lot of things.⁴

So people (including the author) continued studies about the amygdala. One of which
showed participants faces that look scared, which the amygdala *did* respond to, but
it also responded to any faces as long as they were new (maybe some other qualifications
to this). And it also lights up when you learn things. The result, which we expect by
now, is that one one has found any neural fingerprints for emotions. Also, every region
involved in emotion is also doing non-emotions sometimes. 

The last bit here is that the author collected a bunch of brain scans in the form of
voxels, and trained a classifier to recognize emotions based on these. Wait, this sounds
wrong. Well hold your horses, it's not like a predefined pattern. It's a statistical
thing. Like (example from the book) if you train a computer to recognize golden
retrievers, it doesn't have a precise definition of these wonderful creatures, but
relies on averaging over a bunch of dog instances. 

This makes sense, because we already established that emotions are categories which
would mean they are best described by statistical properties. I do feel like that is
kind of a fingerprint, but not gonna get into semantics now.

--------------------

¹ Unless you are a tiger enthusiast, or perhaps even a king, and
 feel like seeing a tiger is a normal and safe situation.

² Typical of scientists to all disagree with each other.

³ You might notice I'm not really telling a coherent story, but it's ok, just embrace
the chaos. There is some cohesion anyway, since this summary is more or less following
the book chronologically on an intra-chapter level, but with some gaps.


⁴ I mean if you think about it, having a 1-1 mapping of brain parts (or networks, which is
the same idea) to emotions would be pretty weird, and not a good modular design, and
just seems like you'd eventually end up with contradictions in the theory. But this
*was* the theory for quite some time.
