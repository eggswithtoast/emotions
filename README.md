# How emotions are made

This repository is where I'm writing notes, summaries, etc, about the book *How Emotions
Are Made*, written by Lisa Feldman Barrett. 

I plan on writing an entry for each chapter I read, before I forget what happened. The
content will be a mix of what I think are important points, unnecessary amounts of
commentary and personal opinions, and maybe some useful interpretation. I hope you enjoy
it. And Lisa, if you happen to find this, I hope you don't mind (but if you do, please
let me know).
