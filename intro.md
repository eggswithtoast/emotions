## Intro

Think about how you feel. Feelings precede awareness of them, and arise naturally and
involuntarily, as if a circuit in the brain was "triggered". It makes sense to think
that these circuits were given to us by evolution, who clearly didn't put much thought
into them. *Thanks, evolution*. When we feel sad, it starts raining directly above our
eyes. When we get mad, blood pressure goes up. In general, we should have a physical
fingerprint for emotions that is more or less the same across all humans. Right? Well..
kinda.

The line of thinking just described is referred to as the classical view of emotions.
Lots of people have been a fan of this view, mainly because it makes a lot of sense
intuitively. People like Aristotle, Freud, and others who can get away with having a
one-word-name. It's also been the basis for a lot of important things, the kind of
things that happen in the world and have important outcomes for people. Like the
judicial system, or companies doing something called "emotion analytics" (which I assume
can lead to nothing good), the FBI incorporating this into training for decades
(apparently they don't do this anymore), or the TSA using 900 million dollars to assess
risk based on translating face/body movements into emotions, which didn't work. And
something something women are more emotional, and doctors dismiss them more often which
is not good for mortality.¹



Besides these "actual things", the classical understanding of emotion is woven into how
we understand others, or for example teach people with autism to understand others.
These aren't even all the examples, and I'm sure there are lots the author doesn't
mention. The point is, we base too many things on emotion and apparently haven't even
understood it correctly, since the point of this book is to form a new theory of emotion
based on neuroscience, which they didn't have when the classical view was put forth.

The new and improved theory is called the *theory of constructed emotion*. The reasons
it is better than the classical one are among the following.

1) When we measure physical responses in people experiencing a given emotion, there is
more variation than consistency in both the brain and body. Like you can be mad without
an increase in blood pressure, or be scared without an amygdala.²


2) There is variation across cultures. I'm not sure exactly what this means yet, but
seems self explanatory.

These observations lead one to believe that emotion is constructed, or the way
I'm currently thinking about it is that it's *learned*. Not like on purpose,
but quite automatically, taking cues from people around us. And maybe there is
some evolution sprinkled in, to guide the process. And my guess is that
individuals may still have something like a fingerprint, but it would depend on
their entire life history, hopefully resulting in categorical failure of
companies to do "analytics" about them.

The author notes that just because emotions are constructed doesn't mean they aren't
real. I'm curious to find out more about what that construction entails, and maybe
understand how I've been feeling, with even a little bit more clarity.

¹ One good thing that has relied on the classical view was that Pixar's *Inside Out*
exists

² I'm realizing that "a given emotion" is not that well defined, but I assume there will
be more clarification on that in subsequent chapters. The point here is the lack of
physical fingerprint, but I don't take that to mean that social understanding of
emotions is suddenly invalidated. Like, sadness is still a thing and we can fairly
reliably communicate about that without too much loss of information.
